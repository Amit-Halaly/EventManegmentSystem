# **Event Hall Management System**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a final assignment developed using the C programming language.\
It focuses on creating an Event Hall Management System, which helps manage bookings and schedule events.\
The program is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, providing essential features for managing events seamlessly.

## **Features**

- **Event Scheduling:** Create, modify, and delete event schedules, including details like date, time, and duration.
- **Booking Management:** Handle bookings for different events, ensuring no double bookings occur.
- **Customer Information:** Store and manage customer details for event organizers.
- **Hall Availability:** Check and display the availability of the event hall for specific dates.
- **Cost Calculation:** Calculate the total cost of an event based on duration, resources used, and other factors.

## **Technologies Used**

- **C Programming Language:** The entire project is developed using C, focusing on procedural programming techniques.
- **File Handling:** Data persistence is achieved through file handling, storing event details, customer information, and booking records.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizes arrays and structs to manage and organize data efficiently.

## **How to Run the Program**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EventManegmentSystem.git
   cd event-hall-management-system
   ```

2. **Compile the Program:**  
   Use a C compiler like GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o event_hall_management main.c
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**  
   ```bash
   ./event_hall_management
   ```

4. **Interact with the Application:**  
   Follow the menu options to manage event schedules, bookings, and other functionalities.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Implement a GUI to enhance user interaction.
- **Database Integration:** Replace file handling with a database for more robust data management.
- **Online Booking System:** Extend the system to allow online event bookings through a web interface.
